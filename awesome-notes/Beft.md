# Mixing

Important process for ensuring uniformity in a batch of fermentation production unit.

## Mechanism of mixing

Accomplishes-

- **Distribution:** Allowing the mixture content to penetrate the deepest and farthest corners of the fermenter. It is the slowest step in mixing. But superimposed by turbulence it can be made efficient. 
- **Dispersion:** Breaking of flow into smaller *eddies*. Ensures rapid transfer of content.
- **Diffusion:** Dispersion is not much more than circular movement of the content. For spreading the content out of the circular path we need to rely on diffusion.

### Eddies

They are the circular flow-fields generated due to the circular movement of the impeller. The can be of different masses depending on the kinetic energy they are carrying. In due course, their sizes decreases and eventually all their kinetic energy dissipates in the form of heat when they no longer sustain any more loss of mass.

### Kolmogorov scale of mixing

AKA, scale of turbulence.

>  **DENOTED AS LAMBDA IN THE SLIDES**

Within eddies of 30~100Î¼m diameter, homogeneity is achieved in about 1 s for low viscosity fluids. Consequently, if power input to a stirred vessel produces eddies of this dimension, mixing on a molecular scale is accomplished virtually simultaneously.

## Assessing mixing

Mixing time is a required parameter to assess the quality of mixing in a reactor. It can be done in several ways-

- Inserting a probe at a fixed point in the reactor container  to take reactor data like pH, conductivity, concentration, etc.
- Measuring temperature response on addition of hot liquid.
  - When a tracer is mixed with the content of the reactor, the concentration/time plot of a single point in the reactor depicts a periodicity. Initially, before tracer could mix properly in the reactor, the probe detects a concentration probe whenever the tracer makes one bulk circulation.
