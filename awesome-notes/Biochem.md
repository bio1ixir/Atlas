# Enzyme kinetics

## Enzyme

- **Cofactor:** Non protein (can be Organic or Non organic) compound assists in biochemical transformation. It is needed for the enhanced activity of the enzyme. **They don't bind the enzyme.** (e.g. iron in haemoglobin)

- **Conenzyme:** **CAN BE REFEREED AS ORGANIC COFACTORS** **Organic**-non-protein compounds which loosely binds to the active site for substrate recruitment.

- **Apoenzyme:** Protein part of the enzyme.

- **Holoenzyme:** (Cofactor/conenzyme)-apoenzyme complex.

  > Recall: Induced fit model

### Factors affecting enzyme activity

-  Environmental conditions
  - pH. *8-8 pH is optimal* (*because of the presence of acidic carboxylic group and basic amino group*)
  - Temperature (*extreme temperature denatures the enzyme*; *at low temperature it don't have enough energy.*)
  - Ionic concentration (*to ensure supply of metallic cofactor ions*)
- Cofactors/Coenzymes
- Inhibitors

### Enzyme Inhibitors

- **Competitive:** Imitates substrate structure
- **Non competitive:** Alters active site structure by binding to the allosteric site
- **Uncompetitive:** Binds to substrate-enzyme complex.
- **Irreversible:** Makes enzyme lose its activity.

### Michaelis-Menten equation

- V<sub>m</sub> is maximum velocity/rate at which enzyme catalyses the reaction. Reached when all sites are saturated.
- K<sub>m</sub> 
  - Is substrate concentration at velocity half of the V<sub>m</sub>. 
  - It implies that half of the active sites have been occupied.
  - Measure of binding strength if the active sites.
  - **Lower the value , higher the affinity b/w enzyme and substrate.**
- [S] is the substrate concentration

### Lineweaver-Burk Plot

- Essentially the plot of reciprocal of MM equation.
- **1/[S]** vs **1/V**  plot

### Eadie-Hofstree Plot

- **V/[S]** vs **V** plot.

### Hanes-Woolf plot

- **[S]** vs **[S]/V**  plot.

# Membrane Proteins

### Types of membrane proteins

- **Transmembrane proteins:** Crosses bilayer in various ways

  - **alpha helix:** satisfies HB requirement of peptide backbone 

    - Single-pass
    - Multi-pass

  - **beta barrel (beta rolled):** satisfies HB requirements of backbone.

    - Single-stranded and multi-stranded **beta sheets** are unstable
    - multi-pass closed **beta barrel** structure is stable 

    > **Single-pass** membrane proteins cross the membrane only once, while **multi-pass** membrane proteins weave in and out, crossing several times

- **Transmembrane lipid anchored proteins:**

### Classification based on transport method 

- Membrane transport [https://ib.bioninja.com.au/standard-level/topic-1-cell-biology/14-membrane-transport/types-of-transport.html]
  - **Passive:** *movement of particles down the gradient from larger to lower concentration. Does NOT require energy.*
    - **Simple Diffusion:** *movement of small particles*
    - **Facilitated:** *movement of large particles/ions via membrane proteins*
      - **Transporters(Carriers)**
      - **Ion channels(Channels)**
  - **Active:** *Movement of particles up the gradient from lower to higher concentration. Expends energy.*
    - **Primary:** *movements requiring direct expense of energy*
      - energy through ATP hydrolysis.
      - Examples of ATP dependent transporters:
        - **P type atpase:** *undergo **phosphorylation** as they transport cations*
        - **F type ATPase:** (energy coupling ***factor***)proton transport complex in mitochondria and bacterial membrane
        - **V type ATPase (similar to F):** *in plant **vacuoles** and acidic vesicles*
        - **A type ATPase:** *does **anion** transportation*
        - **ABC transporters:** *transports drugs, metabolites, ion*
    - **Secondary(Carriers):** *movement happening by coupling with another particle going through the same way.*
      - Energy through free energy of electrochemical gradient caused by ion pumping ATPase.
      - Example- absorption of glucose in intenstine.

### Classification based on channels type

- **Ionophores:** *Increase membrane permeability; Bacterial origin*; eg- K+ transportation
  - **Carriers:** *encapsulates the molecule and drives it across the membrane*
  - **Channels** *Forms channels*
- **Porins:** *beta barrel shape protein structure; eg- maltoporins facilitates transfer of maltodextrins.*
- **Ion channels:** *Ion channels are ionophores; Signal transduction;*
  - **Always open**
  - **Gated:**
    - **Mechanosensitive:** *open in response to local deformation, physical stimuli like touch, sound, pressure.*
    - **Ligand:** *opens in response to neurotransmitter type extracellular stimulus*
    - **Signal:** *open in response to intracellular signalling molecules*
    - **Voltage:** *opens in response to change in membrane potential*
- **Aquaporins:** *water transportation*
  - Discovered by **PETER AGRE**
  - Abundant in kidney, glands. 
- **Transport proteins:**
  - **Uniport:** *one molecule at a time*
  - **Symport:** *two molecules in the same direction*
  - **Antiport:** *two molecules in opposite direction*

### Exo/Endo cytosis

**Exocytosis:** Vesicles encapsulates the content and transfer it off the cell. Neurotransmitters are released in this manner.

**Endocytosis:** Can occur in three ways-

- **Phagocytosis** *"cell eating"*
- **Pinocytosis** *"cell drinking"*
- **Receptor mediated endocytosis:** In this, first ligand binds to the receptors. This causes **Clathrin** and **adaptor proteins** from inside to to bind on the other end of the receptors. This in turns causes an early coated pit formation. As the ligands keep accumulating, pit size increases and then eventually is pinched off from the surface (mediated by PIP2 and Dymin protein) to form a vesicle. After that, uncoating starts to happen where Clathrin is set free from the vesicle.
  - *Phosphatidylinositol 4.5 bisphosphate*(**PIP2**) and protein Dymin has an important role in pinching off of Clathrin-coated vesicle from the cell surface.
  -   Ligands and its receptors are internalised by the means of coated pit containing the receptors.
  - Many viruses attacks this system of the cell. e.g HIV, hepatetis, etc. Iron toxicity occurs due to excessive endocytosis.
